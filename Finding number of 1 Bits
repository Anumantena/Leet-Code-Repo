Problem :

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example:
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.


Solution:

class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        return bin(n).count('1')
