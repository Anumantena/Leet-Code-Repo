Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Python Code:

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        j=0
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):       
            if nums[j]!=nums[i]:
                j+=1
                nums[j]=nums[i]
            
        return j+1
